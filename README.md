# kacAkacT
Dynamical modeling of KacAT Type II toxin-antitoxin regulation in response to Lon protease degradation
1) kacAkacT.ode is XPPAUT file which simulates the dynamics of KacA and KacT. The code produces the phase plane analysis in Fig. 8A.
2) kacAkacT_deltaL_change.m is MATLAB script which produces the change of the steady state for KacA, KacT, and kacAT mRNA in Fig. 8B and 8C.
